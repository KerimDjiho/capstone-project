This is the practical part of the Capstone Project written by Kerim Djiho.

It includes 3 services:
- Rails App service
- PostgreSQL service
- Ngnix service

First you have to install VirtualBox and Vagrant (even though the stack can be deployed without Vagrant)

To deploy the stack, clone the repository and execute "vagrant up" command when in the project directory.
